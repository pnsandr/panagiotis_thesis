abstract = {Satellite datasets show higher chlorophyll concentration in the surface water of the equatorial Atlantic relative to that of the equatorial Pacific. Is the phytoplankton biomass also higher in the Atlantic? To answer this question, a basin-scale ocean circulation-biogeochemistry model that has a phytoplankton dynamic model is utilized to compare the spatial and temporal variations of phytoplankton carbon biomass. We use field data collected in the equatorial Atlantic to derive a new set of biological parameters so that the model can reproduce the general features of the phytoplankton biomass and chlorophyll in this region. For instance, the model reproduces the observed deep chlorophyll a maximum (DCM) that is much deeper to the south ({\~{}} 100. m) of the equator than to the north ({\~{}} 70. m). The simulated surface chlorophyll also compares well with the satellite derived chlorophyll at basin scale for the equatorial Atlantic. Our comparative analyses demonstrate that for the upwelling region, the phytoplankton biomass in the surface water is considerably higher in the equatorial Pacific than in the equatorial Atlantic. However, for the entire euphotic zone, the integrated phytoplankton biomass is much higher in the equatorial Atlantic than in the Pacific. The difference in the surface water simply reflects larger phytoplankton carbon to chlorophyll ratios in the equatorial Pacific, due to strong iron limitation. The difference in the subsurface water is due to a pronounced deep biomass maximum (DBM) existing in the equatorial Atlantic, which is associated with higher nitrate in the lower euphotic zone. This modeling study emphasizes the importance of using variable C:Chl ratios to estimate carbon biomass at regional to global scales. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The impact of changes in shortwave radiation penetration depth on the global ocean circulation and heat transport is studied using the GFDL Modular Ocean Model (MOM4) with two independent parameterizations that use ocean color to estimate the penetration depth of shortwave radiation. Ten to eighteen percent increases in the depth of 1{\%} downwelling surface irradiance levels results in an increase in mixed layer depths of 3-20 m in the subtropical and tropical regions with no change at higher latitudes. While ID models have predicted that sea surface temperatures at the equator would decrease with deeper penetration of solar irradiance, this study shows a warming, resulting in a 10{\%} decrease in the required restoring heat flux needed to maintain climatological sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The decrease in the restoring heat flux is attributed to a slowdown in heat transport (5{\%}) from the Tropics and an increase in the temperature of submixed layer waters being transported into the equatorial regions. Calculations were made using a simple relationship between mixed layer depth and meridional mass transport. When compared with model diagnostics, these calculations suggest that the slowdown in heat transport is primarily due to off-equatorial increases in mixed layer depths. At higher latitudes (5 degrees-40 degrees), higher restoring heat fluxes are needed to maintain sea surface temperatures because of deeper mixed layers and an increase in storage of heat below the mixed layer. This study offers a way to evaluate the changes in irradiance penetration depths in coupled ocean-atmosphere GCMs and the potential effect that large-scale changes in chlorophyll a concentrations will have on ocean circulation.},

abstract = {The variability of sea surface chlorophyll concentration in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic during the first year of Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) imagery is examined. An Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) is used, along with TOPEX/Poseidon dynamic height observations and global gridded wind stress data sets, to explain the physical forcing of surface ocean color signals. Regions of high surface chlorophyll are strongly correlated with mesoscale and large-scale physical processes such as the strong upwelling off the west coast of Africa, the relatively high oceanic production within the Guinea Dome region, and the generation and propagation of large anticyclonic eddies along the coast of South America, north of the equator. The major river outflows (Amazon, Orinoco, and Congo) have strong signatures with plumes of apparently high Chl a in excess of 10 mg m-3 near their deltas. The fall bloom in the eastern tropical Atlantic observed by the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) was absent in 1997, whereas a bloom was observed in this region in July-September 1995, which was not observed by the CZCS. We attribute these apparent anomalies to the projection of the 1997-1998 El Ni{\~{n}}o event into the tropical Atlantic basin; these signals are correlated with sea surface temperature anomalies known to be associated with ENSO. The SeaWiFS images show that there are seasonal blooms within the hydrographic provinces of the Guinea and Angola domes. These hydrographic provinces are characterized by the dynamic uplift of the thermocline at the North Equatorial Current southern boundary (Guinea Dome) and the Benguela Current eastern boundary (Angola Dome). Within these domes, the Ekman pumping and transport are significant due to the strong trade winds at the surface. The Ekman drift plays a major role in the spreading of surface blooms. The spreading of the oceanic bloom at 12"N, 30"W, the Congo River plume, and the areal extent of the {\_}I . upwelling blooms off the coast of Africa, parallels the strength and extent of the Ekman surface drift. Upwelling, when broadly defined to include large scale vertical excursions of the thermocline, explains virtually all of the surface chlorophyll observations in excess of 0.5 mg m-3, except in the river plumes.},

abstract = {Sea surface salinity (SSS) data in the Atlantic Ocean is investigated between 50°N and 30°S based on data collected mostly during the period 1977-2002. Monthly mapping of SSS is done to extract the large-scale variability. This mapped variability indicates fairly long (seasonal) time scales outside the equatorial region. The spatial scales of the seasonal anomalies are regional, but not basin-wide (typically 500-1000 km). These seasonal SSS anomalies are found to respond with a 1-2 month lag to freshwater flux anomalies at the air-sea interface or to the horizontal Ekman advection. This relation presents a seasonal cycle in the northern subtropics and north-east Atlantic indicating that the late-boreal spring/summer season is less active than the boreal winter/early-spring season in forcing the seasonal SSS variability. In the north-eastern mid-latitude Atlantic, SSS is positively correlated to SST, with SSS slightly lagging SST. There are noticeable long-lasting larger-scale signals overlaid on this regional variability. Part of it is related to known climate signals, for example ENSO and NAO. A linear trend is present during the first half of the period in some parts of the basin (usually towards increasing salinities, at least between 20°N and 45°N). Based on a linear regression analysis, these signals combined can locally represent up to 20{\%} of SSS variance (in particular near 30°N/60°W or 40°N/10-30°W), but usually represent less than 10{\%} of the variance. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the modern ocean, oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are potential traces of a primitive ocean in which Archean bacteria lived and reduced chemical anomalies occurred. But OMZs are also keys to understanding the present unbalanced nitrogen cycle and the oceans' role on atmospheric greenhouse control. OMZs are the main areas of nitrogen loss (as N

                        2. It was recently hypothesized that OMZs are going to spread in the coming decades as a consequence of global climate change. Despite an important OMZ role for the origin of marine life and for the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen, there are some key questions on the structure of OMZs at a global scale. There is no agreement concerning the threshold in oxygen that defines an OMZ, and the extent of an OMZ is often evaluated by denitrification criteria which, at the same time, are O
                        2-dependent. Our work deals with the identification of each OMZ, the evaluation of its extent, volume and vertical structure, the determination of its seasonality or permanence and the comparison between OMZs and denitrification zones at a global scale. The co-existence in the OMZ of oxic (in its boundaries) and suboxic (even anoxic, in its core) conditions involves rather complex biogeochemical processes such as strong remineralization of the organic matter, removal of nitrate and release of nitrite. The quantitative OMZ analysis is focused on taking into account the whole water volume under the influence of an OMZ and adapted to the study of the specific low oxygen biogeochemical processes. A characterization of the entire structure for the main and most intense OMZs (O
                        2 {\textless} 20 ??M reaching 1 ??M in the core) is proposed based on a previously published CRIO criterion from the eastern South Pacific OMZ and including a large range of O
                        2 concentrations. Using the updated global WOA2005 O
                        2 climatology, the four known tropical OMZs in the open ocean have been described: the Eastern South Pacific and Eastern Tropical North Pacific, in the Pacific Ocean; the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, in the Indian Ocean. Moreover, the Eastern Sub-Tropical North Pacific (25-52??N) has been identified as a lesser known permanent deep OMZ. Two additional seasonal OMZs at high latitude have also been identified: the West Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. The total surface of the permanent OMZs is 30.4 millions of km
                        2 (???8{\%} of the total oceanic area), and the volume of the OMZ cores (10.3 millions of km
                        3) corresponds to a value ???7 times higher than previous evaluations. The volume of the OMZ cores is about three times larger than that of the associated denitrification zone, here defined as NMZ ('nitrate deficit or NDEF {\textgreater} 10 ??M' maximum zone). The larger OMZ, relative to the extent of denitrification zone, suggests that the unbalanced nitrogen cycle on the global scale could be more intense than previously recognized and that evaluation of the OMZ from denitrification could underestimate their extent. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A global monthly-mean climatology of the air-sea oxygen flux is presented and discussed. The climatology is based on the ocean oxygen climatology of Najjar and Keeling [1997] and wind speeds derived from a meteorological analysis center. Seasonal variations are characterized by outgassing of oxygen during spring and summer and ingassing of oxygen during fall and winter, a pattern consistent with thermal and biological forcing of the air-sea oxygen flux. The annual mean flux pattern is characterized by ingassing at high latitudes and the tropics and outgassing in middle latitudes. The air-sea oxygen flux is shown to exhibit patterns that agree well with patterns seen in a marine primary productivity climatology, in model generated air-sea O-2 fluxes, in estimates of remineralization in the shallow aphotic zone based on seasonal oxygen variations, in observed seasonal nutrient-temperature relationships, and in independent estimates of meridional oxygen transport in the Atlantic ocean. We also find that extratropical mixed layer new production during the spring-summer period, computed from biological seasonal net outgassing of oxygen, is equivalent to the production of 4.5-5.6 Gt C, much lower than previous estimates based on atmospheric O-2/N-2 measurements.},

Transforming such maps into maps of primary production can be reliably done only by using light-production models in conjunction with additional information about the column- integrated pigment content and its vertical distribution. As a preliminary effort in this direction, -4,000 vertical profiles of pigment (Chl a + Pheo a) determined only in oceanic Case 1 waters have been statistically analyzed. They were scaled according to dimensionless depths (actual depth divided by the depth of the euphotic layer, Z,) and expressed as dimensionless concentrations (actual concentration divided by the mean con- centration within the euphotic layer). The depth Z,, generally unknown, was computed with a previously developed bio-optical model. Highly significant relationships were found allowing (C{\textgreater},,,, the pigment content of the euphotic layer, to be inferred from the sur!ace concentration, C,, observed within the layer of one penetration depth. According to their C,, values (ranging from 0.01 to {\textgreater} 10 mg m-3), we categorized the profiles into seven trophic situations and computed a mean vertical profile for each. Between a quasi-uniform profile in eutrophic waters and a profile with a strong deep maximum in oligotrophic waters, the shape evolves rather regularly. The well- mixed cold waters, essentially in the Antarctic zone, have been separately examined. On average, their profiles are featureless, without deep maxima, whatever their trophic state. Averaged values of p, the ratio of Chl a to (Chl a + Pheo a), have also been obtained for each trophic category. The energy stored by photosynthesizing algae, once normalized with respect to the integrated chlorophyll biomass (C),,, is proportional to the available photosynthetic energy at the surface via a parameter {\#}*, which is the cross-section for photosynthesis per unit of areal chlorophyll. By taking advantage of the relative stability of {\#}*, we can compute primary production from ocean color data acquired from space. For such a computation, inputs are the irradiance field at the ocean surface, the “surface” pigment from which (C),, can be derived, the mean p value pertinent to the trophic situation as depicted by the ({\$} or (C),,, values, and the cross-section rc/*. Instead of a constant {\#}* value, the mean profiles can be used; they allow the climatological field of the {\#}* parameter to be adjusted through the parallel use of a spectral light-production model.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study is to review and tentatively to interpret the optical behavior of oceanic case I waters, those water for which phytoplankton and their derivative play a predominant role in determining their optical properties. Chlorophyll-like pigment concentration is used as the index to quantify the algal material (living and detrital), and statistical relationships between this index and the depth of the euphotic layer, the spectral values of the attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance, or the scattering coefficient are investigated. On the basis of these statistical relationships a pigment-dependent optical model is developed. It allows the propagation of the visible radiant energy within the ocean or the backscattered radiation from the upper layer to be predicted as a function of the local phytoplanktonic content. Other geophysical or geochemical applications are derived which concern the heating rate due to penetrating visible radiations or the rate of energy storage due to photosynthesis. The nonlinear trends observed in the algal biomass-attenuation relationships are analyzed by (1) considering the rather regular change of the living-to-detrital organic carbon ratio which seems to occur in oceanic waters ranging from oligotrophic to eutrophic, and (2) accounting for the respective contributions of absorption (by pigmented cells) and of scattering (by all kind of particulates) in the attenuation process of radiant energy.},

abstract = {Within the eastern tropical oceans of the Atlantic and Pacific basin vast oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) exist in the depth range between 100 and 900 m. Minimum oxygen values are reached at 300-500 m depth which in the eastern Pacific become suboxic (dissolved oxygen content {\textless}4.5 $\mu$mol kg-1) with dissolved oxygen concentration of less than 1 $\mu$mol kg-1. The OMZ of the eastern Atlantic is not suboxic and has relatively high oxygen minimum values of about 17 $\mu$mol kg-1 in the South Atlantic and more than 40 $\mu$mol kg-1 in the North Atlantic. About 20 (40{\%}) of the North Pacific volume is occupied by an OMZ when using 45 $\mu$mol kg-1 (or 90 $\mu$mol kg-1, respectively) as an upper bound for OMZ oxygen concentration for ocean densities lighter than $\sigma$$\theta$ {\textless} 27.2 kg m-3. The relative volumes reduce to less than half for the South Pacific (7{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively). The abundance of OMZs are considerably smaller (1{\%} and 7{\%}) for the South Atlantic and only ∼0{\%} and 5{\%} for the North Atlantic. Thermal domes characterized by upward displacements of isotherms located in the northeastern Pacific and Atlantic and in the southeastern Atlantic are co-located with the centres of the OMZs. They seem not to be directly involved in the generation of the OMZs. OMZs are a consequence of a combination of weak ocean ventilation, which supplies oxygen, and respiration, which consumes oxygen. Oxygen consumption can be approximated by the apparent oxygen utilization (AOU). However, AOU scaled with an appropriate consumption rate (aOUR) gives a time, the oxygen age. Here we derive oxygen ages using climatological AOU data and an empirical estimate of aOUR. Averaging oxygen ages for main thermocline isopycnals of the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean exhibit an exponential increase with density without an obvious signature of the OMZs. Oxygen supply originates from a surface outcrop area and can also be approximated by the turn-over time, the ratio of ocean volume to ventilating flux. The turn-over time corresponds well to the average oxygen ages for the well ventilated waters. However, in the density ranges of the suboxic OMZs the turn-over time substantially increases. This indicates that reduced ventilation in the outcrop is directly related to the existence of suboxic OMZs, but they are not obviously related to enhanced consumption indicated by the oxygen ages. The turn-over time suggests that the lower thermocline of the North Atlantic would be suboxic but at present this is compensated by the import of water from the well ventilated South Atlantic. The turn-over time approach itself is independent of details of ocean transport pathways. Instead the geographical location of the OMZ is to first order determined by: (i) the patterns of upwelling, either through Ekman or equatorial divergence, (ii) the regions of general sluggish horizontal transport at the eastern boundaries, and (iii) to a lesser extent to regions with high productivity as indicated through ocean colour data. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Dissolved oxygen in the mid-depth tropical Pacific Ocean has declined in the past several decades1. The resulting expansion of the oxygen minimum zone has consequences for the region's ecosystem2 and biogeochemical cycles3, but the causes of the oxygen decline are not yet fully understood. Here we combine models of atmospheric chemistry, ocean circulation and biogeochemical cycling to test the hypothesis that atmospheric pollution over the Pacific Ocean contributed to the redistribution of oxygen in deeper waters. We simulate the pollution-induced enhancement of atmospheric soluble iron and fixed nitrogen deposition, as well as its impacts on ocean productivity and biogeochemical cycling for the late twentieth century. The model reproduces the magnitude and large-scale pattern of the observed oxygen changes from the 1970s to the 1990s, and the sensitivity experiments reveal the reinforcing eects of pollution-enhanced iron deposition and natural climate variability. Despite the aerosol deposition being the largest in mid-latitudes, itseect on oceanic oxygen ismost pronounced in the tropics, where ocean circulation transports added iron to the tropics, leading to an increased regional productivity, respiration and subsurface oxygen depletion. These results suggest that anthropogenic pollution can interact and amplify climate-driven impacts on ocean biogeochemistry, even in remote ocean biomes.},

The strongest decreases in oxygen occur in the mid-latitudes of both hemispheres, near regions where there is strong water renewal and exchange between the ocean interior and surface waters. Approximately 15{\%} of global oxygen decrease can be explained by a warmer mixed-layer reducing the capacity of water to store oxygen, while the remainder is consistent with an overall decrease in the exchange between surface waters and the ocean interior. Here we suggest that this reduction in water mass renewal rates on a global scale is a consequence of increased stratification caused by warmer surface waters. These observations support climate model simulations of oxygen change under global warming scenarios.},

abstract = {Pathways of subtropical cells (STCs) and the basin-wide meridional overturning circulation (MOC) are studied in the tropical Atlantic using a particle tracking algorithm and transports from a high-resolution ocean model. Here 16 Sv (=106 m3 s-1) of MOC water flows to the equator from the south, primarily in the North Brazil Current. The MOC water recirculates in the tropics and, after crossing the equator about half of it, stays along the western boundary and the other half loops in a cyclonic circulation northward to join the North Equatorial Current. The STC on the Southern Hemisphere has a strength of 4 Sv. The northern STC has a strength of 1.5 Sv; it is confined to the retroflection area close to the equator and it contains primarily MOC water. In total, 5.5 Sv of MOC water entrains into the mixed layer in the tropical Atlantic. Here 2 Sv of MOC water recirculates in the southern STC and 1.5 Sv in the northern STC. The STCs are weaker than suggested from observations, but the interior flows in the model compare well to observations. The heat transport divergence that is associated with warming of MOC water masses between 10°S and 10°N is 0.22 PW (=1015W). The fresh water transport divergence of MOC water masses in the tropical Atlantic is 0.16 Sv. It is concluded that the MOC can substantially affect the tropical circulation, but the tropical circulation itself can also affect MOC properties. Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A more than two-decadal sediment trap record from the Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystem (EBUE) off Cape Blanc, Mauritania, is analysed with respect to deep ocean mass fluxes, flux components and their variability on seasonal to decadal timescales. The total mass flux revealed interannual fluctuations which were superimposed by fluctuations on decadal timescales. High winter fluxes of biogenic silica (BSi), used as a measure of marine production (mostly by diatoms) largely correspond to a positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index (December–March). However, this relationship is weak. The highest positive BSi anomaly was in winter 2004–2005 when the NAO was in a neutral state. More episodic BSi sedimentation events occurred in several summer seasons between 2001 and 2005, when the previous winter NAO was neutral or even negative. We suggest that distinct dust outbreaks and deposition in the surface ocean in winter and occasionally in summer/autumn enhanced particle sedimentation and carbon export on short timescales via the ballasting effect. Episodic perturbations of the marine carbon cycle by dust outbreaks (e.g. in 2005) might have weakened the relationships between fluxes and large-scale climatic oscillations. As phytoplankton biomass is high throughout the year, any dry (in winter) or wet (in summer) deposition of fine-grained dust particles is assumed to enhance the efficiency of the biological pump by incorporating dust into dense and fast settling organic-rich aggregates. A good correspondence between BSi and dust fluxes was observed for the dusty year 2005, following a period of rather dry conditions in the Sahara/Sahel region. Large changes of all bulk fluxes occurred during the strongest El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in 1997–1999 where low fluxes were obtained for almost 1 year during the warm El Ni{\~{n}}o and high fluxes in the following cold La Ni{\~{n}}a phase. For decadal timescales, Bakun (1990) suggested an intensification of coastal upwelling due to increased winds (''Bakun upwelling intensification hypothesis''; Cropper et al., 2014) and global climate change. We did not observe an increase of any flux component off Cape Blanc during the past 2 and a half decades which might support this. Furthermore, fluxes of mineral dust did not show any positive or negative trends over time which might suggest enhanced desertification or ''Saharan greening'' during the last few decades.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Ocean observations are analysed in the framework of Collaborative Research Center 754 (SFB 754) "Climate-Biogeochemistry Interactions in the Tropical Ocean" to study (1) the structure of tropical oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), (2) the processes that contribute to the oxygen budget, and (3) long-term changes in the oxygen distribution. The OMZ of the eastern tropical North Atlantic (ETNA), located between the well-ventilated subtropical gyre and the equatorial oxygen maximum, is composed of a deep OMZ at about 400 m in depth with its core region centred at about 20° W, 10° N and a shallow OMZ at about 100 m in depth, with the lowest oxygen concentrations in proximity to the coastal upwelling region off Mauritania and Senegal. The oxygen budget of the deep OMZ is given by oxygen consumption mainly balanced by the oxygen supply due to meridional eddy fluxes (about 60{\%}) and vertical mixing (about 20{\%}, locally up to 30{\%}). Advection by zonal jets is crucial for the establishment of the equatorial oxygen maximum. In the latitude range of the deep OMZ, it dominates the oxygen supply in the upper 300 to 400 m and generates the intermediate oxygen maximum between deep and shallow OMZs. Water mass ages from transient tracers indicate substantially older water masses in the core of the deep OMZ (about 120–180 years) compared to regions north and south of it. The deoxygenation of the ETNA OMZ during recent decades suggests a substantial imbalance in the oxygen budget: about 10{\%} of the oxygen consumption during that period was not balanced by ventilation. Long-term oxygen observations show variability on interannual, decadal and multidecadal timescales that can partly be attributed to circulation changes. In comparison to the ETNA OMZ, the eastern tropical South Pacific OMZ shows a similar structure, including an equatorial oxygen maximum driven by zonal advection but overall much lower oxygen concentrations approaching zero in extended regions. As the shape of the OMZs is set by ocean circulation, the widespread misrepresentation of the intermediate circulation in ocean circulation models substantially contributes to their oxygen bias, which might have significant impacts on predictions of future oxygen levels.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In the core of theOMZat about 400-m depth, a highly significant oxygen decrease of about 15 $\mu$mol kg-1 is found between the two periods. During the same time interval, the salinity at the oxygen minimum increased by about 0.1. Above the core of the OMZ, within the central water layer, oxygen decreased too, but salinity changed only slightly or even decreased. The scatter in the local oxygen–salinity relations decreased from the earlier to the later period suggesting a reduced fila- mentation due to mesoscale eddies and/or zonal jets acting on the background gradients. Here it is suggested that latitudinally alternating zonal jets with observed amplitudes of a few centimeters per second in the depth range of the OMZ contribute to the ventilation of the OMZ. A conceptual model of the ventilation of the OMZis used to corroborate the hypothesis that changes in the strength of zonal jets affect mean oxygen levels in the OMZ. According to the model, a weakening of zonal jets, which is in general agreement with observed hydrographic evidences, is associated with a reduction of the mean oxygen levels that could significantly contribute to the observed deoxygenation of the North Atlantic OMZ.},

In contrast, the vertical expansion of the OMZs within the Atlantic is linked to increases POC flux as well as changes in oxygen solubility with increasing seawater temperature.

The model is intended to be used for both regional and global configurations at high or low spatial resolutions as well as for short-term (seasonal, interannual) and long-term (climate change, paleoceanography) analyses. There are twenty-four prognostic variables (tracers) including two phytoplankton compartments (diatoms and nanophytoplankton), two zooplankton size-classes (microzooplankton and mesozooplankton) and a description of the carbonate chemistry. Formulations in PISCES-v2 are based on a mixed Monod–Quota formalism: on one hand, stoichiometry of C/N/P is fixed and growth rate of phytoplankton is limited by the external availability in N, P and Si. On the other hand, the iron and silicium quotas are variable and growth rate of phytoplankton is limited by the internal availability in Fe. Various parameterizations can be activated in PISCES-v2, setting for instance the complexity of iron chemistry or the description of particulate organic materials. So far, PISCES-v2 has been coupled to the NEMO and ROMS systems. A full description of PISCES-v2 and of its optional functionalities is provided here. The results of a quasi-steady state simulation are presented and evaluated against diverse observational and satellite-derived data. Finally, some of the new functionalities of PISCES-v2 are tested in a series of sensitivity experiments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM) modifies the upper ocean heat capture distribution and thus impacts water column temperature and stratification, as well as biogeochemical processes. This energetical role of the DCM is assessed using a 1 m-resolution 1D physical-biogeochemical model of the upper ocean, using climatological forcing conditions of the Guinea Dome (GD). This zone has been chosen among others because a strong and shallow DCM is present all year round. The results show that the DCM warms the seasonal thermocline by +2°C in September/October and causes an increase of heat transfer from below into the mixed layer (ML) by vertical diffusion and entrainment, leading to a ML warming of about 0.3°C in October. In the permanent thermocline, temperature decreases by up to 2°C. The result is a stratification increase of the water column by 0.3°C m−1 which improves the thermocline realism when compared with observations. At the same time, the heating associated with the DCM is responsible for an increase of nitrate (+300{\%}, 0.024 M), chlorophyll (+50{\%}, 0.02 g l−1) and primary production (+45{\%}: 10 mg C m−2 day−1) in the ML during the entrainment period of October. The considered concentrations are small but this mechanism could be potentially important to give a better explanation of why there is a significant amount of nitrate in the ML. The mechanisms associated with the DCM presence, no matter which temperature or biogeochemical tracers are concerned, are likely to occur in a wide range of tropical or subpolar regions; in these zones a pronounced DCM is present at least episodically at shallow or moderate depths. These results can be generalized to other thermal dome regions where relatively similar physical and biogeochemical structures are encountered. After testing different vertical resolutions (10 m, 5 m, 2.5 m, 1 m and 0.5 m), we show that using at least a 1 m vertical resolution model is mandatory to assess the energetical importance of the DCM.},

Results from a suite of surface chlorophyll perturbation experiments show that the mean state and variability of the tropical Pacific is highly sensitive to the concentration and distribution of ocean chlorophyll. Setting the near-oligotrophic regions to contain optically pure water warms the mean state and suppresses variability in the western tropical Pacific. Doing the same above the shadowzones of the tropical Pacific alsowarms the mean state but enhances the variability. It is shown that in- creasing penetration can both deepen the pycnocline (which tends to damp El Ni˜ no) while shifting the mean circulation so that the wind response to temperature changes is altered. De- pending on what region is involved this change in the wind stress can either strengthen or weaken ENSO variability.},

According to this definition, regime shifts differ from species replacement or alternation of species at similar trophic levels, whereby the ecosystem is not necessarily significantly altered in terms of its structure and function; only its species composition changes. This paper provides an overview of regime shifts, species replacements and alternations that have been observed in the northern and southern Benguela ecosystems over the past few decades. Bottom-up control, initiating and sustaining regime shifts or species replacements via environmental forcing, is documented for both the southern and the northern Benguela ecosystems. Fishing (a case of top-down control) appears to have played an important role in regime shift processes in the Namibian ecosystem. Very low biomass levels of exploited fish stocks associated with less efficient energy transfer in the northern Benguela are indicative of a regime shift. Very high biomass levels have been reached in the southern Benguela in the 2000s. However the alternation between sardine and anchovy that has been observed in the southern Benguela over the last two decades appears not to have had major effects on the overall functioning of the ecosystem. The consequences of regime shifts for exploitation are highlighted, suggesting that fisheries managers should move towards a more effective ecosystem approach to fisheries. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
